LightGBM vs XGBoost: Titanic Dataset Analysis
Objective
This project aims to compare the performance of LightGBM and XGBoost algorithms using the Titanic dataset. The analysis includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, model building, and a comparative analysis of the results.

Project Structure
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Loading the Titanic dataset.
Checking for missing values.
Exploring data distributions using histograms and box plots.
Visualizing feature relationships with survival rates using scatter and bar plots.
Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values.
Encoding categorical variables using one-hot or label encoding.
Applying additional preprocessing techniques if necessary.
Model Building:

Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
Building predictive models using LightGBM and XGBoost.
Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Applying cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize the models.
Comparative Analysis:

Comparing the performance metrics of LightGBM and XGBoost.
Visualizing and interpreting results to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm.
